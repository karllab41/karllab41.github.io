[Google's codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/) are extensive, and we will work with [style transfer in android studio](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-style-transfer-android/index.html). Eventually, I'd like to do a style transfer of faces to more handsome/pretty other people's faces.

First requirements are to download Android App Studio. This could take a good twenty minutes.
