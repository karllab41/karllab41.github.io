Because I work mostly on the backend, my knowledge is limited on the front end. My reaction to terms like Angular, Node.js is typically to nod and hope nobody notices me.

The next few blog posts are some notes on how to make a foray into (maybe) useful app development, on the web and/or the phone, and connecting to some of the newer machine learning tools. 

## Quick Ramp with N00B Tech Debt

In reality, if you'd like to leverage pre-built technology with little to no customization, throwing something up on the web is quick. The codelabs at Google have pre-canned technology that is copy-paste ready, which enables you to create websites like the following:

- [Image classification](/subpages/tensorflow_js/2018-09-20-tensorflow-part-1)
- [Posenet](/subpages/tensorflow_js/2019-04-06-tensorflow-part-2)
- [Audio classification](/subpages/tensorflow_js/2019-04-06-tensorflow-part-3)

The sites use someone else's neural network, and there isn't much recourse if you'd like to tailor the app to your needs.
