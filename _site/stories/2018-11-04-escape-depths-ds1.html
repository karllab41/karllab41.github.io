  <article class="post-content">
    <p>“Hurry! Get in!” I shouted at my partner.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/interests/mechbot-small.jpg" alt="MechBot" /></p>

<p>I quickly settled into the cockpit of a large mechanized robot, a <em>mechbot</em>. About forty feet away in the underground hangar, my partner, a uniformed man in a dark green military suit, leapt towards me as an alarm started wailing.</p>

<p>The bay doors cracked open, though I knew that there would be a wall of guards outside it in a convoluted mess of a hallways. I had a map in my head, and navigated the football field’s worth of offices, men with guns, and granite walls between us and the surface.</p>

<p>A few bullets whizzed by us and clanged and ricochetted off the bulletproof glass of my still open windshield door, the visor that was my mech’s “eyes”. My partner managed to climb up and into the cockpit, just as I started the mech’s power source. The automated visor slowly whirred down to closed position, and I powered up the weapons system.</p>

<p>More ricochettes off the mechbot. I turned our mechbot and dashed towards the hanger doors…<em>toward the soldiers</em> that were shooting at us.</p>

<p>“I’m assuming you have a plan,” my partner calmly quipped. Ever the professional.</p>

<p>“Yeah, I got it.”</p>

<p>The bullets weren’t the problem; none of the armed guards appeared to carry high power rifles, and even if they did, the ceramic armor layered on top of the mechbot machinery could defeat most kinetic energy projectiles. In truth, the only weaponry to be worried about at the moment would be artillery pieces towards the rear of the hangar, which is why I was charging the guards. By placing them between us and the guards,the guards would have to go through or around us to get to the M777 howitzers.</p>

<p>We started taking longer strides, leaping 15 feet per step, and we closed on the front lines at the hangar entranced within seconds. The chips on the bullet resistant glass were multiplying in force. As we approached the firing line of the soldiers, most of whom were hunkered beyond wooden crates. Their commander, even at our distance away I could tell, was a dimunitive man compared to his soldiers, but he realized our intentions. I imagined his eyes widening as he quickly turned his head to the dispatch radio on his shoulder and shouted something over the gunfire. Too late, I smirked as we jumped over the front lines and through the hangar doors.</p>

<p>We landed squarely outside the hangar doors, and I could tell that the shell-shocked soldiers inside weren’t clear on what their next move would be. Do they fire in towards us…towards the offices outside the hangar? Do they give chase? What could they do? If I were them, I would start looking for gainful employment elsewhere, because the ease that I had purveyed in stealing a $15M piece of equipment would make any Congressman blush.</p>

<p>No time to empathize with them now, though. Their more immediate concern was trying to kill us, and our was trying to escape. I turned the mechbot outwardly toward the elevator shafts near the end of the large hallway. While the hangar was an immense underground construction achievement, the hallways abutting the facility were dimunitive, and the mechbot needed to crouch to avoid the ceiling. I could safely ignore the gunfire behind us now that the mechbot visor wasn’t getting shattered and I could see through the heads up display.</p>

<p>We broke through the shaft ceiling, and a mix of sand and glass shattered as we jumped right out through the top into the surrounding sands. We’d made it! Not many land-vehicles and machinery could keep up with us now. We started running, as I ran some calculations about our hydrogen nuclear fuel cell and the nearest populated areas where we could disappear.</p>

<p>My partner yelled out, “I’ll start scanning radio frequencies to provide some accurate intelligence so we know where to go.”</p>

<p>Seems rational, I thought. I continued in the current direction for the time being.</p>

<p>Then, a fog of doubt rolled over my mind. I was sure in my ability to drive and operate mechbots, and despite understanding the floor plan of an incredibly complex facility, I started becoming confused. It never entered my mind as to why I could so dexterously operate complex machinery. The controls seemed natural. More than these trivial realizations, I became confused about my confusion itself. In our haste, I had never contemplated why it was that we were escaping. Understanding a concept like this would have required a lot more context than I was given. Why?</p>

<p>I caught a glimpse of the reflection of my partner; a sly smile crept onto on his face when he realized that my thought processes slowed. It wasn’t an enthusiastic expression, but rather, a Mona Lisa grin.</p>

<p>Then, abruptly, he diverted his eyes while surfing the FM band of radio frequencies. The static noise in the cockpit briefly cleared up, while the robotic hymns of our mechbot’s periodic rocking filled the void. Then voices: local news.</p>

<p>“…these men are considered highly contagious in addition, of course, to being armed and dangerous. If approached, cover your mouths and noses, as there is no known cure for the afflictions that they suffer from. Avoid contact with them at all costs, and alert your local authorities. Let professionals reason with them as they may have had some amnesia due to the infection…”</p>

<p>I had relied on my lizard brain, apparently. And then, I began to understand everything…and opened my eyes, promptly becoming hopelessly confused again.</p>
