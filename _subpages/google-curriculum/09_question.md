This one is actually taken from CTCI, but it's relevant to some of the statistics problems you may face. 

You have a basketball hoop and someone says you can either:

1. Shoot once and win if you make the hoop
2. Shoot three times and you win if you make two of three

If *p* is the probability of making the shot, what's the value of *p* that delineates case one from case two in terms of advantages
