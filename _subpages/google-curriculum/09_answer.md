Recall the question:

You have a basketball hoop and someone says you can either:

1. Shoot once and win if you make the hoop
2. Shoot three times and you win if you make two of three

If *p* is the probability of making the shot, what's the value of *p* that delineates case one from case two in terms of advantages

Solution

The probability that you'll win game one is *p*. The probability that you win game two is: 3*(1-p)*(1-p)*p + p*p*p. Therefore, you can solve for p.
