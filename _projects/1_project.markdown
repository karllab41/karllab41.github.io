On October 4, 2018, Amanda was at home with her mom, and Karl was at work finishing up some projects. We were expecting to give birth the next week on October 9, and so we were taking it slow. Amanda had walked in the morning, and she was getting cramps in her stomach. She didn't know these were contractions!

Around 5pm, Karl received a call from Amanda, and she said, "I think you should come home now." Karl immediately gathered his things and drove home. When he got home, we left immediately for the hospital. It was rush hour traffic, and we took El Camino Real all the way. The pain was getting more frequent, a "6" on a scale from one to ten, when the nurses at the front desks asked.

## in labor and delivery

Usually, you're admitted if you are 4 inches dialated. It turns out Amanda was a full six inches dialated, and would need to immediately go into a labor room. We were admitted, and the nurses were on a shift change. Many of them remarked how tall Amanda was because of her position on the bed.
